- Input folder path should be in this formate:
    if you want to run this script in "My_folder" the input type will be: path/to/My_folder/

if you run this script in  any folder , it will rearrange your files with respect to file types 
for example,
all image files will be organized in Images folder
all video files will be organized in Videos folder
similarly it organizes all of your files
